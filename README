This Matlab code contains the functions to implement the dual decomposition 
method of Khan et al (2013). It is packaged as a supplement to the code in 
'sparse_var_inf_ggpm'. See 'sparse_var_inf_ggpm/README' for more information.

*** 1. Setup ***

The directories in this package should be added to the Matlab path after the
directories for the 'sparse_var_inf_ggpm' package have been added.

*** 2. Overview ***

The included objective functions and corresponding optimization variables are:

    f_obj_dual_l        dual parameter under GGPM

The triplet of Matlab structures (model,data,params) is used throughout the 
code. For the dual method, the params structure is augmented with:

params:
    dual:           [structure]
        lambda:     [Ntrain x 1]            dual parameter (see Khan 2013)

Note, this Matlab code provides two edited versions of functions included in the
minFunc package: minFunc_rs.m and minFunc_processInputOptions_rs.m. The edited 
functions allow for supplying the minFunc optimization procedure with a step 
size bounding function (only used in the dual decomposition method). The 
bounding function can be added as a field to the minFunc options structure:

    opts.stepfunc = @dual_max_step_func
